## Our workflow

1. Go to [Our project board](https://github.com/Lifespark-Technologies/Infomed/projects/1).
2. Pick an unassigned card from the "To do" column and assign it to yourself. If you want to work on something that is assigned to someone else, talk to that person (or @bl-nero) first.
3. As soon as you start working on an issue, move it to the "In progress" column. Don't assign yourself to tasks that are in progress, but also don't hold on to a task that you can't contribute to in a reasonable timeframe.
4. Request a code review. Don't merge code without it. Don't push code directly to `master`.
